# ## Academic Integrity Statement
# 
# * All electronic devices are prohibited during the exam except for the following uses:
#     - Checking the LEARN news item for this exam periodically for any clarifications or corrections.
#     - Completing the exam (Jupyter Notebook, Interactive Python Interpreter, Text Editor with/without syntax highlighting and basic autocomplete)
# * No aids, references, or notes are allowed that are not specified above.

# 
# 
# **5.** Given the array $A$. Which of the following methods for making a new array, named $b$, would result in changes in $A$ if the values in $b$ are changed?
# 
# $$ 
# A = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
# 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
# 9 & 10 & 11 & 12\\

# 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 \end{array} \right], \quad 
# $$
# 
# > **a)** `b=A.flatten()`

def merge_dictionary(a, b):

    (dict, dict) -> dict

    This function takes two dictionaries, `a` and `b`, and returns a new dictionary, `c`, containing the entries from both `a` and `b`. 

    Both `a` and `b` will use strings as keys, and lists as values.
    If a key, `K`, is present in both `a` and `b` then the new dictionary should have an entry for it 
    and the value associated with `K` should be the result of concatenating the values in `a[K]` and `b[K]`, in that order.

    Note: DO NOT modify either `a` or `b`. Take care not to do this directly, or indirectly.

    >>> merge_dictionary({'hello': ['world']}, {'beep': ['boop']})
    {'hello': ['world'], 'beep': ['boop']}

    >>> merge_dictionary({'hello': ['world']}, {'hello': ['moto']})
